{"rating": "PG-13", "summary": "Another Harvest Moon is a sensitive drama about four elderly Americans coping with life in a nursing home. Frank (Ernest Borgnine), Ella (Anne Meara), Alice (Doris Roberts) and June (Piper Laurie) gather each morning for a game of cards. They have become like family to one another, offering unyielding support, constant bickering and strong opinions about life, death and everything in between. One morning Frank reveals to Ella that he no longer remembers his wife's face and that he doesn't want to live to endure another debilitating stroke. He persuades his son Jeffrey (Richard Schiff) to give him his old gun because by holding it he finds a way to remember his World War II buddies. But perhaps he has another motive for wanting the weapon. Frank's revelation sets off a struggle between Ella and the ever-optimistic Alice as they both try to affect his decision while privately dealing with their own fears. That Labor Day Jeffrey, daughter Vickie (Cybill Shepherd) and grandson Jack (Cameron Monaghan) take Frank on a camping trip where his spirits are lifted. Back at the nursing home Frank ponders his decision and his next move. His friends and family must confront their own feelings about faith, dignity and our obligations to our loved ones. Another Harvest Moon deals with weighty issues affecting us all.", "related": ["dumbstruck", "dumbstruck", "dumbstruck"], "trailer": "content/movies/anotherharvestmoon/anotherharvestmoon-tlr1_h480p.mov", "title": "Another Harvest Moon"}
