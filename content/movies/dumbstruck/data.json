{"rating": "PG-13", "summary": "\"Dumbstruck\" follows five professional ventriloquists at all levels of ability and fame over the course of the most unusual year in ventriloquism history: Dylan, a shy 13-year-old whose dream of being a professional conflicts with his dad's preference for football; Kim, a former Miss Ohio beauty queen, who yearns to 'make it' on the cruise ship circuit; Dan, a successful cruise ship performer who struggles to maintain a family life, although he is on the seas much of the year; Terry, who, after a 22 year struggle to \"make it\" in Corsicana, Texas, finds himself on NBC's \"America's Got Talent\" with a chance to win $1 million; and Wilma -- all six-foot-five of her -- who brings her dummies to Walmart and 'entertains' in senior homes. Along the way, Terry Fator emerges from obscurity to sign a 100 million dollar Las Vegas deal to become the most successful ventriloquist in history. With its heart firmly planted on its polyester sleeve, Dumbstruck takes the American dream sideways and never loses its way.", "related": ["dumbstruck", "dumbstruck", "dumbstruck"], "trailer": "content/movies/dumbstruck/dumbstruck-tlr1_h480p.mov", "title": "Dumbstruck"}
